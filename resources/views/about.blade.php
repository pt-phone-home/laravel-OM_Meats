                    O’Mahony Meats was established by William Joe O’Mahony in August 1964. He opened a family butcher shop in Killester, a growing neighbourhood on the north side of Dublin.

                    Kieran, one of his sons, joined the small family business in the 1980s and subsequently developed O'Mahony Meats into a thriving wholesale business.

                    In the early noughties O’Mahony Meats moved to a purpose-built EC-licensed factory on the outskirts of Dublin northside with easy access to both the M50 and the city centre.
At the same time the meat factory went back to its roots: we opened a genuine factory shop where our customers can buy a wide range of quality meats at wholesale prices.
