                    O’Mahony Meats was established by William Joe O’Mahony in August 1964. He opened a family butcher shop in Killester, a growing neighbourhood on the north side of Dublin.

                    In the 1980s, one of his sons, Kieran, joined the family business, which then consisted of his father, another butcher and a part-time book-keeper. Kieran turned to Dublin city centre restaurateurs in order to develop O’Mahony Meats.

                    Ten years ago, as the company had outgrown its Killester premises, it moved to a purpose-built EU licensed factory in the Malahide Road Industrial Park, Coolock. A genuine factory shop was also opened where O’Mahony Meats has been selling meats of the finest quality at wholesale prices to the general public since September 2004.
